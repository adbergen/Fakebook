# Fakebook

[Fakebook live](https://fakebook-dla.herokuapp.com/#/)

Connect with family, friends, and the world with Fakebook, a clone of Facebook built on Ruby on Rails and React/Redux. Fakebook is a social media platform on which one can interact with other users and speak one's mind. A user can post to their own wall, add friends, and post to their friends' walls.

## Feature Highlights

### The Wall

Roger Waters? David Gilmour? Walking hammers? No, not THAT wall——at Fakebook, the wall is where your friends communicate with you, and where you can communicate with them. Enjoy the work-appropriate joke shared to your profile by a close friend on the other side of the country, and let all your friends know your opinions on the latest summer blockbuster by posting a status. If you enjoy posting text, the possibilities are endless. The wall is built such that the same React components will eventually also serve the homepage feed.

### Profiles

The wall is just one component of the profile. A profile displays a user's profile picture, banner picture, user introduction, and location information. Additionally, the one's profile hosts links to one's Fakebook friends.
